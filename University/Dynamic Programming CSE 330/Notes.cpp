#Dynamic Programming Notes:
	Approaches : 
		1. Memorisation Approach :
			We store the table first and look in the table for previous values and the compute our solution.
			It is a top down approach.
		2. Tabulation approach:
			We build the tables step by step as we go along the solution and use the previous step solution to
			get the answer of next step.
			It is bottom up approach as we go on top by building answers step by step.
		time(tabulation_approach) < time (memorisation_approach) < time (recursion (exponential time))
